<h1>Descendance</h1>
<p>
    "Descendance" is taken from a section of the track “A World Beyond” / “Hidden in the Beyond”
    from the albums of the same title.

    When I started putting together the music that became <em>A World Beyond</em>, I had a lot of
    unfinished pieces. I wanted to finish some tracks and put them onto an album.
</p>
<p>
    Somewhere along the way, I decided to join some of the shorter tracks into longer tracks,
    with mixed results. Some tracks were clearly stuck together, while other combinations worked
    better than I expected.
</p>
<p>
    “Descendance” is one of those pieces. Originally called “Climbing the Peak” (a title I reused
    for a bonus track on <em>A Change of Scenery</em>) it was halfway between catchy and repetitive.
    For the track “A World Beyond”, I took another track, “Land of Far”, and put the original
    “Climbing the Peak” onto the end. Of the two, this is definitely the better track.
</p>
<p>
    Later, for <em>Hidden in the Beyond</em>, I added more pieces after this track:
    “Twinkles”, a brief variation of “Moon Eclipse”, and a short bridge leading to “Raindrops”.

<h2>Remix</h2>
<p>
    Splitting it from “A World Beyond” and retitling the track “Descendance” (a kind of opposite title
    to “Climbing the Peak”) resulted in a running time of 1:40. For the remix, I lengthened the track,
    changed the instruments, and replaced a few of the melodies. Fundamentally, it’s clearly still the
    same track, albeit a little more developed.
