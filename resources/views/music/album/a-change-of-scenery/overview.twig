    <em>A Change of Scenery</em> is my fifth album. Its name comes from my relocation back to the UK
    in 2009, after two and a half years living in Australia.

    The cover is typically British: a snowy landscape with a red phone box. An alternative cover
    included a photo of me in front of Big Ben.

    The album includes mostly loose ends: unreleased material from previous albums or albums I never
    completed (see below for details), alongside remixes ("Longing", "Nebular Dreaming",
    "The Wilderness, Part 2", "Lifeline II"), a very old track from my archives ("Fallen Leaves"),
    plus a handful of brand new tracks to balance things out ("Moonsurfing", "The Spiral Staircase",
    "Starlining").

    <em>A Change of Scenery</em> also feels like a bookend for my first five albums. It took me six
    years to release another album - and the next album was quite different.
