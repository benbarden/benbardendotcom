            <h2>Professional profile</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I'm currently working as a Scrum Master / Delivery Manager.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I enjoy development, especially shipping high quality, working software.
                    Shipping is more important than agonising over perfect code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I’ve trained and worked as a tester. It completely transformed my view of development.
                    All devs should try testing (not just unit testing). I have a natural aptitude for
                    exploratory testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I’ve run several projects as a technical PM, worked as a Scrum Master for teams using
                    Kanban or Scrum, and contributed to hands-on coding, code reviews,
                    writing/reviewing tickets, performing QA, and taking on ops tasks to free up developers
                    where I can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition to tech and QA skills, I have experience of JIRA admin, and can tame a tricky
                    backlog. I've been called a JIRA ninja!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Focus: I’m a problem solver. I enjoy getting to the root of issues, removing friction and pain points,
                    thereby maximising a product’s potential.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Organisation: I’m unfazed by having multiple priorities. I align a product’s roadmap with team
                    capabilities and business needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attention to detail: I look at the big picture and I also get into the details when needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quality-focused: I believe that even the smallest bugs can add up to a below-par experience.
                    I address issues to maintain high product quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strong communication: I maintain clear and coherent communication whether I’m dealing with technical
                    or non-technical people. I can explain business requirements to developers, and translate jargon
                    into plain English as required.
                </li>
            </ul>
