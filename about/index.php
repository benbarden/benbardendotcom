            <p>I've worked in tech since 1998 and have had a variety of roles, including software developer, web developer,
            QA manager, tech team lead, IT support, project manager, and most recently product director.</p>
            <p>My strengths include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>directing teams - I have interviewed and hired tech staff, worked with them to find solutions to
                    product requirements, and managed a large number of project launches, enhancements, maintenance work
                    and optimisation;</li>
                <li>user experience - I feel strongly that excellent UX is critical to a successful product. I'm always
                    looking for ways to reduce friction, streamline processes, and help people to do their jobs faster
                    and better;</li>
                <li>organisation - I enjoy making order from chaos, and have proposed and implemented numerous process
                    improvements at every company I've worked. I'm also good at running technical projects;</li>
                <li>attention to detail - I look at the big picture as well as focusing on smaller details. When time
                    and/or budget is tight, small changes can still make the biggest difference - while also minimising
                    risk;</li>
                <li>clear and coherent written and verbal communication at all levels of an organisation - technical and
                    non-technical staff, managers and directors.</li>
            </ul>
