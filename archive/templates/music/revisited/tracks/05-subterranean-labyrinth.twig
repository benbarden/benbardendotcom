                    "Subterranean Labyrinth" is track 10 from <em>A World Beyond</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Original track description:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    A homage to the dungeons in various Zelda games. You never know what’s around the next corner
                    until it’s too late. Lots of suspense.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    As stated above, the piece was inspired by the underground dungeons in “Zelda” on the NES and the SNES.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The opening bars were going round and round my head one day back in 1995. So much so,
                    I had to write them down. It wasn’t until 2003 that I actually wrote the main section of the piece,
                    which was initially called “All Sides Blocked”. Although the main melody from that piece remains,
                    the rest is very different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my view this is the best track on <em>A World Beyond</em>.
                </p>
                <h2>Remix</h2>
                <p>
                    There have now been a few versions of this track:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the original, from <em>A World Beyond</em>;</li>
                    <li>“Underground Maze”, from <em>Hidden in the Beyond</em>;</li>
                    <li>the GFD remix from <em>Symmetry 2</em>;</li>
                    <li>the <em>Revisited</em> remix.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This version is a slight variation of the GFD remix I produced for <em>Symmetry 2</em>, with a few
                    additions and tweaks.
