            <h3>A note on timeslots</h3>
            <p>I have calculated the full duration of the episodes if they filled their timeslots exactly.
                So while an episode might be 46 mins, in the UK it may be in a 50 min timeslot.
                Timeslots are accurate based on the BBC Media Centre information.

Currently assuming this is episodes 11 and 12.</li>

The first article quotes a section where Moffat appears to suggest that two of his scripts are in the second production block, but this quote was missing from the Radio Times article. If this part is correct, the assumption is that Hettie MacDonald is directing two standalone stories by Moffat. I've also assumed they are episodes 1 and 2, which may not be the case.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/missy-back-in-two-part-series-9-opener-70966.htm">Missy Back in Two-Part Series 9 Opener</a> (Doctor Who TV, 19 Feb 2015) - My previous assumption was mostly correct. Block 2 has episodes 1 and 2, written by Moffat and directed by Hettie MacDonald. However, they also form a two-part story. This means for the first time in the new series of Doctor Who, we have back to back two-parters spanning the first four episodes of the series. Considering we mostly likely have a two-part finale as well (as the penultimate episode is a cliffhanger), are we on track for an entire series of two-parters?</li>

And sometimes something that looks like it’s going to be a single, isn’t a single.</em>" (DWM #484) On this basis, I've made some assumptions. Previously we heard that episode 5 is a single-parter; however, the two new titles appear to be linked. So, I've assumed these episodes could be numbered 5 and 6 in the run, with a linked storyline, but not an official two-parter. I've also assumed that we haven't missed any episodes and that the stories are not being filmed out of order. I could be totally wrong, or I could be dead right. It's speculation, after all.</li>

Apparently, the first six episodes will be three consecutive two-parters. I speculated on this a few weeks ago, when the opener was revealed to be a two-parter.</li>

The director matches up with the Merlin &amp; Atlantis director point above, however, it doesn't say anything about episode 10 being a two-parter. For now, I've taken Wikipedia's lead and put episode 9 as a Mark Gatiss story. Episodes 5 and 6 have one director but different writers; that could be the case for episodes 9 and 10, too.</li>
